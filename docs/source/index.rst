Welcome to Hedgehog!
====================

Hedgehog is a robot controller: a device for controlling robotics components.
Hedgehog is particularly suited for educational use, but great care was taken to make it flexible and usable in a wide range of use cases.
Its most important features and properties are as follows:

- full control over your device
    - use all capabilities of the built-in Raspberry Pi 3
    - all open hardware and software
    - no limitations for advances users
- easy connectivity to programming devices
    - wired via Ethernet
    - wireless via WiFi
    - Web-based Hedgehog IDE or SSH
- unified command protocol
    - control your Hedgehog locally or over the network
    - protocol stack designed for reliability
    - easy to implement in many popular programming languages
    - few assumptions to allow for various approaches in programming interfaces
- versatile application programming interfaces (APIs)
    - visual programming via Blockly
    - textual programming mainly via Python, but node.js and Java already supported as well
    - simple, yet not limiting
- made for tinkering and hacking
    - compatible with RC servos & DC motors, various analog and digital sensors
    - controller case can be mounted to Lego models
    - hardware blueprints (case & circuit boards) available for modification
    - CAD software, microcontroller toolchain, git, ... pre-installed on the controller
- classroom ready
    - One WiFi for all controllers avoids network congestion
    - many educational use cases, appropriate for various ages
    - visual & textual programming, closed-loop control, autonomous driving, microcontroller programming,
      distributed systems, swarm intelligence, ...
